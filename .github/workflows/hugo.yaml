    Host and deploy
    Host on GitHub Pages

Host on GitHub Pages
Host your site on GitHub Pages.
Types of sites

There are three types of GitHub Pages sites: project, user, and organization. Project sites are connected to a specific project hosted on GitHub. User and organization sites are connected to a specific account on GitHub.com.

See the GitHub Pages documentation to understand the requirements for repository ownership and naming.
Prerequisites

Please complete the following tasks before continuing:

    Create a GitHub account
    Log in to your GitHub account
    Create a GitHub repository for your project
    Create a local Git repository for your project with a remote reference to your GitHub repository
    Create a Hugo site within your local Git repository and test it with the hugo server command
    Commit the changes to your local Git repository and push to your GitHub repository

Procedure

Step 1
    Visit your GitHub repository. From the main menu choose Settings > Pages. In the center of your screen you will see this:

    screen capture

    Change the Source to GitHub Actions. The change is immediate; you do not have to press a Save button.

    screen capture
Step 2
    In your site configuration, change the location of the image cache to the cacheDir as shown below:

    caches:
      images:
        dir: :cacheDir/images

    See configure file caches for more information.
Step 3
    Create a file named hugo.yaml in a directory named .github/workflows.

    mkdir -p .github/workflows
    touch .github/workflows/hugo.yaml

Step 4
    Copy and paste the YAML below into the file you created.
    .github/workflows/hugo.yaml

            uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
            with:
              path: ./public
      deploy:
        environment:
          name: github-pages
          url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        needs: build
        steps:
          - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
            id: deployment
            uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4

Step 5
    Commit the changes to your local Git repository and push to your GitHub repository.
Step 6
    From GitHub’s main menu, choose Actions. You will see something like this:

    screen capture
Step 7
    When GitHub has finished building and deploying your site, the color of the status indicator will change to green.

    screen capture
Step 8
    Click on the commit message as shown above. Under the deploy step, you will see a link to your live site.

    screen capture

In the future, whenever you push a change from your local Git repository, GitHub Pages will rebuild and deploy your site.
Customize the workflow

The example workflow above includes this step, which typically takes 10‑15 seconds:

- name: Install Dart Sass
  run: sudo snap install dart-sass

You may remove this step if your site, themes, and modules do not transpile Sass to CSS using the Dart Sass transpiler.
